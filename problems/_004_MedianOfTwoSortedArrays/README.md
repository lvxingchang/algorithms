https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/description/

# Description
There are two **sorted** arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).

**Example 1:**
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
**Example 2:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
